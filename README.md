# iOS/Android Asset Exporter

Just a basic sketch plugin to export assets of iOS and Android to their respective folders in a Single-Click!

## Shortcuts

* cmd + alt + a

You can use this shortcut and continously keep adding your assets to a particular location as it will store your initially selected file path.

## Credits
This plugin is based on [Ozzik's] project [Slicer]. I needed a quick & easy way to export assets of iOS & Android platforms and provide it to the dev-team that's the reason I made use of his existing slicing & exporting layers. Pls check out his project if you need more flexibility & features.
